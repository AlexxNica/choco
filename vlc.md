#### Smooth Variant

Blend every ingredient together to make guarana and liquorice subtly enhance
the chocolate flavour without being noticed too much.

- Temper the [75% Chocolate Base](http://shop.borgodoro.it/products/chocolate-base-75) at **42C** while pouring the [Guarana Powder](http://shop.borgodoro.it/products/guarana-powder) and the [Liquorice Powder](http://shop.borgodoro.it/products/liquorice-powder).
- Press it on the stamps and let it cool gradually till it gets to **21C**.
